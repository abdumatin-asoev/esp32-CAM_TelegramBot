This project uses an ESP32-CAM and a motion sensor to watch for movement.
When someone or something moves, the motion sensor detects it.
Then, the ESP32-CAM takes a photo and sends it to your Telegram using the internet (Wi-Fi).

So basically, it’s a smart camera that watches a place and sends you a photo when it sees movement.

It’s great for home security, checking who enters your room, or even watching pets!
